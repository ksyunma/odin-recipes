Hi! 
This is my first ever project of the TOP Fundamentals Curriculum.
I am a tiny bit familiar with HTML from a short course i had in my uni last year. But since i didn't practice anything, i forgot most of the things i've learnt.
I am hoping to successfully finish this project in a reasonable amount of time (i.e. in a couple days to a week), get familiar with the workflow of webdev, get comfortable with HTML and by the end be able to write everything on my own (without constantly checking tags and the way the code is written), and finally i would like this project to be full, not a "ah, i don't have time to finish it, it'll do" kin of project.
Starting date 04 June 2024.
