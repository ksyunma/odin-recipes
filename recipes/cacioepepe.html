    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cacio e pepe is one of Rome's essential pasta dishes, served at restaurants all over the Italian capital. Like many of the Eternal City's best dishes, a good cacio e pepe recipe is about simplicity. Classic versions call for just pasta, salted water, freshly ground pepper, and Pecorino Romano, a Roman sheep's milk cheese.</p>
    <p>Ours tosses a bit of Grana Padano or Parmesan into the mix for a more rounded cheese flavor that melds warmth, nuttiness, and sharpness.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta (such as egg tagliolini, bucatini, or spaghetti): 170 gr</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter(cudeb, divided): 45 gr</li>
        <li>Coarsely ground black pepper, plus more: 15 gr</li>
        <li>Finely grated Grana Padano or Parmesan cheese: 200 gr</li>
        <li>Finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese: 80 gr</li>
        <li>Salt: to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps of preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add your pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until about 2 minutes before tender. Drain, reserving 200 ml of pasta cooking water. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt the butter, add coarsely ground black pepper and cook, swirling pan, until toasted about 1 min.</li>
        <li>Add half of the reserved pasta water to the butter and bring to a simmer. Add cooked pasta. Reduce burner to low heat and add Grana Padano and Parmesan, stirring and tossing with tongs until melted. Remove pan from heat; add Pecorino Romano, stirring and tossing until cheese melts and sauce coats the pasta (Add more pasta water if sauce seems dry).</li>
        <li>Transfer pasta to warm bowls, garnish with more black pepper, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
